unicon
======
Uniform contrast light and dark colorscheme for Vim (GUI and 256 color terminal).

This colorscheme is heavily inspired by [solarized][], [gruvbox][] and [lucius][].

I liked the idea, solarized based on: 8 monotonous and 8 accent colours, where accent colours are chosen to present even contrast, high identifiability and readability. But it wasn't implemented very well in solarized, in my opinion, mainly due to  low contrast. So it was decided to reimplement those ideas.

Differences from solarized:
* unicon has higher contrast;
* accent colours have actually the same contrast to background;
* different set of accent colours for light and dark variants of colorscheme;
* highlighting of syntax groups is different;
* There are not language- and plugin-specific syntax for now.
